Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there's an escaped fish.

They're not aliens, they're Earthâ€¦liens! You've swallowed a planet! Father
 Christmas. Santa Claus. Or as I've always known him: Jeff. I'm nobody's taxi 
 service; I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like
  jumping out of a spaceship.

Did I mention we have comfy chairs? You know how I sometimes have really 
brilliant ideas? I am the Doctor, and you are the Daleks! I'm nobody's taxi 
service; I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like
 jumping out of a spaceship.
